# Bifurcation Theory and Enterprise Management

## Project Overview

This research explores the application of bifurcation theory from nonlinear dynamics 
to enterprise management, organizational strategy, and sustainable business development.

### Key Concepts

- **Bifurcation Theory**: Mathematical framework for understanding critical transitions
- **Enterprise Management**: Application to organizational strategy and decision-making
- **Economic Dynamics**: Connection to macroeconomic models and market behavior
- **Chaos Control**: Multi-agent systems and adaptive management
